This project demonstrates a simple user authentication and role management system using FastAPI. It includes features such as user registration, login, and role-based access control. The project uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management and provides a basic HTML interface for user login. The roles supported are admin, teacher, and student, with different access permissions for each role. The project also includes database models for users and students, and uses SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
